Project Details: Asynchronous Programming & Multithreading Demo in C#
Objective:
To improve application performance by implementing asynchronous programming and multithreading techniques, demonstrating non-blocking execution, concurrent processing, thread management, and safe resource sharing.

Key Features Implemented:

Asynchronous API Data Fetching:
Simulated multiple API calls running concurrently using async/await and Task.WhenAll, allowing non-blocking parallel data retrieval.

Parallel Data Processing:
Used Task Parallel Library (Task.Run) to process data items concurrently on separate threads, improving throughput.

Thread-Safe Counter:
Implemented a shared counter with lock to prevent race conditions while updating the processed item count.

Background Monitoring:
Created a monitoring component using BackgroundWorker to simulate ongoing background tasks running independently of main processing.

Logging via ThreadPool:
Logging performed asynchronously on ThreadPool threads to avoid blocking main threads.

Asynchronous File Saving:
Data saved asynchronously to disk without blocking the main thread, demonstrating real-world I/O operations.

Concepts Demonstrated:

async/await for asynchronous, non-blocking code

Task Parallel Library (TPL) for concurrent execution

ThreadPool for background task scheduling

lock keyword to handle race conditions

BackgroundWorker for background task execution

Deadlock avoidance strategies by using a single lock and avoiding nested locksProject Details: Asynchronous Programming & Multithreading Demo in C#
